2001ee3,AlexDeLaCour,Added ability to water crops,Crops now grow faster when watered (at the moment, 2x speed)
Can only harvest the crops when they are fully grown
Including placeholder animation for watering crops
,Wed Feb 15 13:24
8edab13,AlexDeLaCour,Added placeholder watering sprite sheet,,Wed Feb 15 12:28
f0e77b7,AlexDeLaCour,Added basic crop planting/harvesting,Can plant and harvest a crop
Crops have a lifecycle counter that keeps track of how long they've been alive
This updates even when we leave the scene in which they're instantiated
Their position is also saved so that they can be respawned in the scene with the correct age and in the correct position
Can also harvest them, deleting them and keeping track of how many crops are harvested

7a81071,AlexDeLaCour,Added walk and idle animation transitions,Added extremely basic placeholder assets for 4 directional walk and 4 directional idle animations
Created said animations, and an animator controller
Added code to transition between idle and walk animations, as well as to set the direction the player is facing
,Sun Feb 12 14:32
b7b84d4,AlexDeLaCour,Added follow camera,Follow camera saved as a prefab - includes main camera and cinemachine virtual camera brain.
Camera follows the player location with a bit of leeway
Values of the follow camera will almost certainly be altered once we start adding the art and know the sizes we're working with
,Fri Feb 10 11:27
469fd67,AlexDeLaCour,Added fade in/out, basic grid system,Added a fade out and in between scenes, and a bool to stop player movement during the fadeout
Moved scene changing functionality out of the player controller and into a separate script and made a scene changer prefab.
Added a basic grid system - plenty to be improved on there and there's probably better ways to approach the problem but it's a good(ish) starting point.
