PR1NC3: Vas! You’re back! 

<<characterEmotion Player "happy" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: Hello there! Did you miss me?  

<<characterEmotion Player "happy" PrinceTalksprite>>
PR1NC3: Maybe… 

PR1NC3: Anyway, how are you doing?  

<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" MerchantTalksprite>>
<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" PrinceTalksprite>>
Vas: Quite good! Managed to secure some interesting goods. I should be able to sell them for a big sum. 

<<characterEmotion Player "happy" PrinceTalksprite>>
PR1NC3: I’m glad to hear that!

<<characterEmotion Player "happy" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: How are you? Farming going well? 

<<characterEmotion Player "sad" PrinceTalksprite>>
PR1NC3: Yes… I just wanted to talk to you about something.

<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: What’s going on? 

-> PR1NC3: I remembered something about the incident. 

<<characterEmotion Player "sad" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: Is that so?

<<characterEmotion Player "sad" PrinceTalksprite>>
PR1NC3: Vas… I think I caused our ship to crash. 

Vas: I knew it would come to this…  

<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: Prince, listen. I just want you to remember that no matter what your mind is telling you, it wasn’t your fault.  

<<characterEmotion Player "angry" PrinceTalksprite>>
PR1NC3: But it was! I messed with the control panel, caused the engine to overheat and we crashed. Everything would be fine if not for me. 

Vas: You didn’t mean to do it. You told me that you couldn't control your body and were forced to follow the commands you had programmed. 

<<characterEmotion Player "sad" PrinceTalksprite>>
PR1NC3: … 

Vas: It’s your superiors who are at fault, not you.  

<<characterEmotion Player "angry" PrinceTalksprite>>
PR1NC3: I should have fought stronger to stop myself. 

<<characterEmotion Player "angry" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: It’s your superiors who are at fault, not you. Nothing you say will change my opinion on that.  

<<characterEmotion Player "sad" PrinceTalksprite>>
PR1NC3: I just… I miss them so much. They were my family and now they’re gone. I cannot stand the thought that I hurt them. 

<<characterEmotion Player "sad" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: I know, but you’re not going to help them by blaming yourself. You will be reunited. 

PR1NC3: How many times did we have this conversation?   

Vas: … Quite a few. It never gets easier, especially seeing you hurt over and over again.  

<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: But I will do it as many times as you need it.  

PR1NC3: I don’t know what to say. 

Vas: You don’t need to say anything. Here, take this, that’s the least I can do to help

PR1NC3: Thank you for staying by my side Vas.

Vas: Hello there. How’s the farming going?  

PR1NC3: The ship is almost charged, I will be leaving soon.  

<<characterEmotion Player "sad" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: Oh, sure. I’m happy to hear that.

<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: Where are you heading next?  
PR1NC3: I will try and get closer to our original target planet. I think it makes sense for them to go there as well.  
Vas: Sounds like a good idea.  

PR1NC3: Do you have more seeds for me? They would come in helpful.  

<<characterEmotion Player "angry" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: … Yeah, here, have these.
