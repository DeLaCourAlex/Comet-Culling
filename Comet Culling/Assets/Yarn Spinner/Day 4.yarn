Vas: Hello! I see you’re up bright and early.  

<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" PrinceTalksprite>>
->PR1NC3: I need to tend to my crops. 

<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" PrinceTalksprite>>
Vas: Of course, how is that going?  

->PR1NC3: Slow but steady. What brings you here again?  

Vas: I wanted to check up on you!  
-> PR1NC3: Oho, according to my data, that suggests you like me or something.

<<characterEmotion Player "happy" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: Of course I do! You’re my friend and I want to make sure you’re ok.

<<characterEmotion Player "sad" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: It pains me to see you alone. I really hope you can be reunited with them.  

<<characterEmotion Player "sad" PrinceTalksprite>>
->PR1NC3: … 

PR1NC3: Yeah me too. They were my crew.  

<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: I know, but don’t worry! You’re getting closer, I’m sure. And in the meantime, I’ll do my best to keep you company!  

<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" PrinceTalksprite>>
->PR1NC3: I… I really appreciate it.  

<<characterEmotion Player "sad" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: So, do you want to talk about them? 

-> PR1NC3: Not really…
    <<characterEmotion Player "sad" PrinceTalksprite>>
    <<jump NoCrewInfo>>
-> PR1NC3: Maybe? I don’t really know what to say.
    <<characterEmotion Player "neutral" PrinceTalksprite>>

<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas:  Why don’t you just tell me something about them?

-> PR1NC3: Sally was my captain, Emilia the engineer and Jonah the medic.

Vas: Ok but what were they like?

PR1NC3: …

<<characterEmotion Player "sad" PrinceTalksprite>>
-> PR1NC3: Sally was… is a really considerate person. She cares about rules but safety of her crew always comes first. 

<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" PrinceTalksprite>>
   PR1NC3: She was willing to drop whatever she was doing if one of the crewmates needed her.

<<characterEmotion Player "happy" PrinceTalksprite>>
-> PR1NC3: Emilia prefers to spend time on her own and is very dedicated to her research. Jonah wouldn’t have that though. 
     PR1NC3: He tried to coax her into leaving her lab and socialising more. I think she didn’t mind it half as much as she said she did. 

<<characterEmotion Player "happy" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: See? It’s good to see you smile. It suits you. Did it make you feel better?

<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" PrinceTalksprite>>
<<characterEmotion Player "neutral" MerchantTalksprite>>
-> PR1NC3: I think so? I haven’t spoken to someone about them in a while. It actually feels like they aren’t that far away now.

<<characterEmotion Player "happy" MerchantTalksprite>>
Vas: I’m glad. Here, take these seeds. Hopefully they will help you find them sooner.

<<characterEmotion Player "happy" PrinceTalksprite>>
-> PR1NC3: … Thank you Vas.
    <<set $affinity to true>>
    <<jump Quit>>
-> PR1NC3: No need. I am doing ok on my own. I need to get back to work now.
